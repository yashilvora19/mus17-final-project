## Prompt Tuning an LLM to Assist Hip Hop Artists in Creating Rap Music

This project explores using prompt tuning to assist Hip Hop artists in creating rap music. I will be leveraging the Gemini API to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) and employ various techniques, such as Chain of Thought prompting, to guide the model towards completing different creative tasks.

### What is Prompt Tuning?

Prompt tuning is a technique for fine-tuning an LLM by providing it with specific prompts and desired outputs during training. This refines the model's ability to perform tasks aligned with those prompts.

###  Project Aims

This project aims to empower Hip Hop artists by:

* Generating creative ideas for lyrics
* Crafting rhymes and enhancing flow
* Overcoming writer's block and sparking inspiration
* Facilitating the creative process of rap music composition
* Refining existing lyrics and polishing verses

###  Implementation Approach

1. **Prompt Tuning:** The Gemini API will be used to prompt tune an LLM specifically for rap music generation tasks.
2. **Web Interface:** Streamlit will be employed to create a user-friendly web application for interacting with the tuned LLM.
3. Python as the programming language.
